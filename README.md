# My AWS S3 Static Website

This is a small static website I built and hosted on **Amazon S3**, served globally through **CloudFront**, and deployed automatically using **GitHub Actions**. It's a simple project that demonstrates how to host a serverless website in the cloud with automated deployments.

## How it Works

- I push updates to GitHub  
- GitHub Actions syncs the files to S3  
- CloudFront distributes the site worldwide and handles HTTPS


## Skills Practiced
- Hosting static websites on AWS S3  
- Using CloudFront for CDN and HTTPS  
- Automating deployments with GitHub Actions
